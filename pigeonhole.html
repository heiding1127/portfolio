                      <li>3. Students find it hard to communicate with their educators outside of class.</li>

                    <p>
                      I created a survey to learn about cloud storage apps and their users. I asked questions about which apps participants use and which features they found most important and used most frequently. I also asked what their hardest part was as students/educators and what are the features they would like to have if there were educational assessment tools.

                            To see where Pigeonhole will sit in the market, I needed to dig deeper into the world of cloud storage and organization apps. I did a competitive analysis for Google classroom, Pinterest, and Dropbox.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Overall, I think they all are good in different ways and serving different purposes. Google classroom is focusing on education purposes for class but the service might be too general that might be hard to a bigger scale class to use it or any professor who has multiple classes. The advantage is that with Google, everything is linked in together and saved automatically. Pinterest serves a purpose for researching or gathering ideas platforms like cooking, decorating, fashion, gardening, and other topics of interest to women. Most of the users do not use it as a storage platform. Dropbox is one of the most popular cloud storage services. It’s easy to use and able to access with any devices but they are pricey compared to other similar services such as google drive.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I noticed that there’s no actual cloud storage app that can be combining all of these functions. What if Pigeonhole can offer users all these functions at once? Will it create a new learning experience for students and help educators to be more successful?

                        <p>Katy cares about her kids' education. She spends lots of time with her kids to help them on their homework. However, it is not easy for her because she may not understand all the questions, and the only way to get help from the teacher is to wait until they are in class. She thinks it would be great if there was a tool for her kids to ask questions whenever they needed.</p>

She also has a few group projects, a large number of contents, or notes in her current cloud storage. It’s hard for her to look for the files effectively and always having problems with file accessibility with her professor. She is always busy with the other things so she needs to have access to file anytime on the go so that she can make sure everything works well.</p>

                        Keeping the personas in mind, I compiled a list of high priority user stories and converted them into user flows to show how the user can accomplish primary tasks, like the two below.

                        When the wireframes were done, I was able to test them with a few people to collect some early feedback. Most of the comments were about how it may be confusing, so I considered this when moving into the High fidelity wireframes.

                        Pigeonhole is a fun, professional and trustworthy brand. I believe colorful and fun illustrations will help students to be more engaged and interested in using this program.  It builds a personality and comprehensive look + feel - it evokes a sense of education like "building blocks".

                      Pigeonhole is a metaphor of this business, students organizing things in their own locker or shelf. It’s a unique name and lends itself to a really great visual. This bold line pigeon head as the icon with the round logotype is the simplest way to represent the brand - Pigeon and also metaphor of kids. The round logotype is easy to read and memorable as well.

                    <p>
                      Using UsabilityHub, I put my iterations to test by creating several A/B tests including a dashboard placement and a text filling design preference test to identify which organizational display of elements within the category page was most favored.

                        Option A’s middle panel is simpler than option B, everything looks easier to access.
